## Pure Pursuit Algorithm


The Pure-pursuit algorithm is a simple and efficient path-tracking algorithm used to determine the steering angle of a vehicle as it follows a specific path.  
This is based on the vehicle's current position and a target point on the path.  
In this algorithm, the distance to the target point that the vehicle aims to track is defined by a parameter called the Look-ahead distance,  
represented as the variable Lfc in the code. Below are the observed results when varying the Lfc parameter.

A cascade-structured controller was designed to control a motor under load.  
(position-velocity-Torque controller)  
The designed controller was implemented on the Atmega128 microcontroller to control the motor.  
In Visual Studio 2017, a user interface (UI) was designed, and ODE simulations were applied.  
Finally, the controller was deployed on the Atmega128, and motor control was achieved through communication between Atmel Studio and Visual Studio.  

When a desired angle is input, the robotic arm moves clockwise or counterclockwise to reach the specified angle.  
At this time, the angle can be entered in two modes: Joint Mode and Infinite Mode.  
- In Joint Mode, the arm moves only within the range of -180° to 180°.
- In Infinite Mode, the arm rotates continuously to reach the desired angle without any range limitation.  

For example:
- Joint Mode: 320° → -40°
- Infinite Mode: 400° → 400°

## Cascade Controller
A current controller was designed, and based on its frequency response, a speed controller was subsequently designed.  
Similarly, considering the frequency response of the speed controller, a position controller was designed.  
  
For the position controller, PD control was employed to ensure precision and stability.  
Both the speed and current controllers utilized PI control, and to prevent error accumulation, values were compensated using anti-windup gain.  
  
Saturation limits were set for each controller to ensure the outputs did not exceed predefined thresholds.

## Gain Tuning

During the project, individual tuning was performed using MATLAB simulation to achieve effective control by considering the physical characteristics of the motor and the properties of the control system.  
The values obtained from MATLAB were applied to the actual DC motor for control, and the control was successfully achieved.  
Additionally, the PID gains can be further fine-tuned based on the desired characteristics.
